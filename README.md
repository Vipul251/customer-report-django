# Customer Data Summary Report with Django

This project is designed to use Django to process and display a customer data summary report. The report is generated by processing data such as the `Cust State`, `Cust Pin`, and `DPD` (Days Past Due), which is stored in a database or CSV file. The summary includes the count of customers, average Days Past Due, maximum DPD, and minimum DPD for each state.

## Project Overview

The project is a Django-based application that uses a backend to handle data processing. It includes a web interface where the customer data summary is displayed. The data can be loaded from a CSV file or directly entered into the database through Django models.

### Input Data Format

The input data contains:
- **Cust State**: The state where the customer resides.
- **Cust Pin**: The customer's pin code.
- **DPD**: Days Past Due.

### Key Features:
- **Customer Summary Report**: Displays the count, average DPD, maximum DPD, and minimum DPD for each state.
- **Django Backend**: The project utilizes Django to manage the logic and database.
- **Data Input**: The data can be added manually via Django admin or imported from a CSV file.
- **Data Processing**: The DPD statistics are calculated and displayed in the report.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language used for the backend logic.
- **Django**: A web framework used for handling data and displaying reports.
- **SQLite** (default database for Django) or any other relational database system like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
- **pandas**: A Python library used for data processing and CSV handling.

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to get the project running locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository using Git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-data-summary.git
cd customer-data-summary
2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
Creating a virtual environment will help isolate the project’s dependencies.

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages listed in the requirements.txt file.

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you don't have a requirements.txt file, you can manually install Django and pandas:

bash
Copy code
pip install django pandas
4. Set Up the Django Project
Once the dependencies are installed, make sure the Django project is properly set up:

Create Database Tables (Migrations)
Before running the project, you need to apply database migrations to create the necessary tables.

bash
Copy code
python manage.py migrate
Create a Superuser (Admin)
To manage the data via Django Admin, create a superuser.

bash
Copy code
python manage.py createsuperuser
You will be prompted to provide a username, email, and password.

5. Run the Development Server
To start the development server and access the application locally, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
By default, the server will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

6. Access Django Admin
To manage customer data, you can use Django's built-in admin interface. Log in with the superuser account created in the previous step. Access the admin interface at:

arduino
Copy code
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin
7. Add Data to the Application
There are two main ways to add data to the application:

Manually through Django Admin: You can add data via the Django admin interface after logging in as the superuser.

Bulk Import from CSV: You can write a Django management command or use pandas to read a CSV file and populate the database.

Django Management Commands
Running Django Commands
To run various Django commands, you can use the following syntax:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py <command>
Common Django Commands:
Run the Development Server:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
This will start the development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

Create Migrations: If you have made changes to the models, you need to create a migration:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py makemigrations
Apply Migrations: To apply the migrations and set up the database:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py migrate
Create Superuser: To create a superuser account to access the Django admin:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py createsuperuser
Test the Project: Run the project’s tests:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py test
Start an App: To create a new app within the project:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py startapp <appname>
